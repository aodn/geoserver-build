PRIORITY

- factory for Variable to hide detail of attribute parser instantiation.

TODO

- postgres - parametize query parameters, rather than use text, injection attack
- refactor variable class to avoid being both definition and mutable buffer - srp
- spring
- investigate netcdf generation in memory
    See here,
    http://www.massapi.com/source/manual/thredds/cdm/src/main/java/ucar/nc2/NetcdfFile.java.html#576
    and
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/v4.6/netcdf-java/javadocAll/ucar/unidata/io/InMemoryRandomAccessFile.html
    
- pass table as parameter to encoder strategy (not sure)

----

WHAT'S DONE

- done get dates correctly encoded  (to enable verificiation of filter date range)
- done sequencing the definition, and data writing phases of netcdf generation
- done basic subset expression parser/
- done postgres dialect rewriter instance
- done netcdf encoder
- done localized convention/ config strategy
- done experimented with a couple of query approaches favor time to start streaming, total time etc.
- done - write required attributes with strategy
- done - write multiple files (and get the writable instantiation working ) (pass at the time).
- done-  should specify dimension of a var by name, then we can infer size/count.
- done - think we have to invert it, instead of trying to infer, use an explicit configuration.
	- It's part of the task.
	- meaning use spring.
- done - mvn project
- done layer configuration into xml file
- done need to be able to select different feature types - and command line arguments
- done take dims from config file..
- done - have a timeseries, need a trajectory. failsafe to run a specific integration test...
- done xml config.
- done factor encoder strategy chooser - so it's not instantiated, or else use property setters instead of constructor for the writer.
- done tidy xml examples - to be more complete .
- push the sql projections into the xml.
- done done check integration test IT naming conventions. change test names to ITtimeseries with IT first
- done get date correctly encoded
---

- done - organize project sources
- done - add support to parser/expr for geometry for spatial constraint choice
- done - zip the file stream
- done - move db connection management into unit tests.
- done - the createWritable generates local files, - needs to be able to handle creating/using concurrently
- done - interface and single method to communicate with server.
- done - cql filter subset expression parsing
- done - wkt
- done - config to specify the tables. eg. xml
- done - attribute arrays.
- done - attribute values are typed - check GG xml. check ncdf api.
- done - gg all dimensions and attribute variables
- done order of dimensions and attributes
- done carry a context when decoding the xml, to perform lookup of dimensions, etc...
- done index on prod data.
- done sql lookup for global attributes
- done - logger
- done - java linter
- done - prototype demonstrate end-to-end filter to subset netcdf generation, with streaming on prod data.
- done - need float and string cql literal types.
- done - unary operators
- done - fix qc vars which are being encoded incorrectly?
- done - Angus cql examples - in integration tests
- done - fix integration tests + naming
- done - integration test should use a subset of prod data and be included in github
- done - re-check that works with profile, and trajectory
